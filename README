Nested Sampling
===============

An extremely simple nested sampling routine based on code
by Dr. John Skilling. Nested sampling is an alternative
(improved?) MCMC approach to finding maximal posterior
solutions to Bayesian problems. 

This code uses the idea of 'eggs' classes  which hold all 
information about the problem. Multiple eggs (held in a 
utility class 'basket') roll around the nest searching
for the optimal solution. On each iteration the egg with 
the poorest likelihood is rejected in favouor of an 
evolved copy of one of the eggs with a better likelihood.
